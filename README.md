# MyCodeForML

Machine learning algorithm by python:
This is a summary of my machine learning coding practice, including most of the main stream machine learning algorithms. Most of the coding are based on Peter's Machine Learning in Action(MLA), which is a awesome book for ML learners. Also added some other interesting algorithms that not included in MLA. hopes this material can help more people on learning ML, and anticipate your feedback.
